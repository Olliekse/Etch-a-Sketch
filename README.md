# Etch-a-Sketch
This project is called Etch-a-Sketch - it's a simple web page designed to illustrate flexbox's ability to make grids.

## Development
I started by sketching a design for the app on paper, then moved onto building the HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I ran into trouble when I couldn't get the grid to have the correct amount of rows and columns, but I solved it by tweaking the formula that calculates the box width and height.

## Technologies Used
This project was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Improvements
- Add more features
- Refactor the code
- Use grid instead of flex
